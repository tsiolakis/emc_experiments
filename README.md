# EMC & SI Experiments
A series of experiments conducted as part of my Electromagnetic Compatibility couse in the University of Twente in March 2022. The experiments aim to provide insight on various SI (Signal Integrity) and EMC issues:
- Self-Inductance
- Lenz' Law
- Packaging Parasitics and Non-deal Behavior of Capacitors
- Grounding of Filters
- Discontinuities
